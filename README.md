## __Why it is interesting:__ 
This article is about a software engineering project, so hopefully this is allowed. The article is interesting because I don't think anyone fully foresaw the effects that the cloud would have on software development when the public first became aware of it. It seems so intuitive that you could stream necessary code and resources now that the article has been published and consumed, but it's quite impressive that these software engineers conceived and produced this idea in the first place. This 'app streaming' software reduced the space taken up by storage heavy gaming apps on an Android phone by 85%, which is incredible. This kind of storage reduction is extremely useful and really opens up the mobile space for more development.

## __Comments:__
* This is an interesting article because it goes along with the current trend of switching to streams over local ownership. With things like Google Stadia, it seems a lot of software companies are shifting to allow people with less powerful machines to run large applications remotely. I don't know if this trend will continue, but it seems to just be getting started. (Jack Heinemann) </br>
* I agree with Alison and Jack for this article's relevancy. If the usage of 'streaming software' becomes a norm, hardware companies will stop designing machines with large memories for client computers. Instead, efforts to build servers with large memories can increase. (Ayako Ohara)
